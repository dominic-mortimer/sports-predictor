# Sports Predictor

The purpose of this project will be to predict the outcome of regular season NBA games, given the historical performance of a team up until that point in the season.  It makes use of the NBA games dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games), and is a bit of a personal project that is a work-in progress at the moment.  

EDA and data cleaning is performed in the `EDA.ipynb` script, while a look-up table for teams' winning percentages is generated in `LUT_Generator.ipynb`.
